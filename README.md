# tabata_timer
A basic exercise timer for interval training

I created this to get a better grasp of tkinter as a afternoon project. I will return to it as I improve in python and find time to do something that isn't directly related to a lesson.

## Things I would like to change in the future

- Make set limit adjustable
- Add better GUI which shows progress, ie 8/10 sets complete
- Add sounds
